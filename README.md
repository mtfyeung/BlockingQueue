# BlockingQueue
Tutorial-style talk "Weeks of debugging can save you hours of TLA+".  The inspiration  for this tutorial and definitive background reading material (with spoilers) is ["An Example of Debugging Java with a Model Checker
"](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/programming-tlabuffer.html) by [Michel Charpentier](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/).  I believe it all goes back to [Challenge 14](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteen) of the c2 wiki.

Each [git commit](https://github.com/lemmy/BlockingQueue/commits/tutorial) introduces a new TLA+ concept.  Go back to the very first commit to follow along!  Please note that the git history will be rewritten frequently (especially when you create PRs).

[Click here for a zero-install environment to give the TLA+ specification language a try](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/lemmy/BlockingQueue).

This tutorial is work in progress. More chapters will be added in the future. In the meantime, feel free to open issues with questions, clarifications, and recommendations. You can also reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lemmster).  Basic TLA+ learning material can be found over at [Lamport's TLA+ page](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/learning.html).

### v01: Java and C implementations with configuration p4c3b3.
    
Legacy Java code with all its bugs and shortcomings.  At this point
in the tutorial, we only know that the code can exhibit a deadlock,
but we don't know why.
    
What we will do is play a game with the universe (non-determinism).
Launch the Java app with ```java -cp impl/src/ org.kuppe.App``` in
the background and follow along with the tutorial.  If the Java app
deadlocks before you finish the tutorial, the universe wins.

(For the c-affine among us, ```impl/producer_consumer.c``` is a C implementation of the blocking buffer sans most of the logging).

### v00: IDE setup, nothing to see here.
    
Add IDE setup for VSCode online and gitpod.io.
